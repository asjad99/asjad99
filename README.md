####  Hi there 👋

 - I'm a final year computer science Ph.D. student :mortar_board: at the University of Wollongong :classical_building:
 - My recent work centres around exploring applications of machine learning for process analytics, expert decision support and Natural Language Understanding of domain specific text. 
 - I have a passion for building intelligent systems(data products) and using them to solve real world problems. I write about my experiences at https://www.asjadk.io
 - I enjoy coding in Python and am a open-source enthusiast. Below i have shared some of the my recent Research Prototypes (Proof-of-Concept), course projects and side projects done in the past.

“If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”

"A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it."
