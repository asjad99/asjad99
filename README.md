####  Hi there 👋

 I'm a final year computer science Ph.D. student :mortar_board: at the University of Wollongong :classical_building:. My recent work centres around exploring applications of machine learning for process analytics, expert decision support and Natural Language Understanding of domain specific text. I have a passion for building intelligent systems(data products) and using them to solve real world problems. I write about my experiences at https://www.asjadk.io. I enjoy coding in Python and am a open-source enthusiast. Below i have shared some of the my recent Research Prototypes (Proof-of-Concept), course projects and side projects done in the past.

####  Research Projects  🔭 :electron:	

The field of Artifical intelligence and Machine Learning is full of [fascinating open problems](https://www.asjadk.io/real-world-rl/) like [Generalization](https://www.asjadk.io/generalization/), [intelligent exploration vs exploitation](https://www.asjadk.io/strategic-exploration-in-online-decision-making/), [counter-factual evaluation](https://www.asjadk.io/counterfactual-policy-evaluation/), [Meta-Learning
]() and Sample Efficient Learning. Progress in solving these problems, can have a major impact impact on domains like industrial automation, healthcare and Education. 


##### Decision Support Systems: 

###### Healthcare 

Digitization of healthcare data along algorithmic breakthroughts in AI will have a major impact on healthcare delivery in coming years. I'm particularly interested in application of AI to assist clinicians during partient treatment. While scientific knowledge can help guide interventions, there remains a key need to quickly cut through the space of decision policies to find effective strategies to support people. 
 
- In  [MIMIC-RL](https://github.com/asjad99/MIMIC_RL_COACH) we investigate the problem of developing a Clinical Decision Support System for Sepsis Management using Deep Reinforcement Learning. In our implementation we try to answer the following question: Given a particular patient’s characteristics and physiological information at each time step as input, can our proposed framework learn an optimal treatment policy that can prescribe the right intervention(e.g use of ventilator) to the patient each stage of the treatment process, in order to improve the final outcome(e.g patient mortality)?   [[Paper]()] [[Blog Post]()]. 
- Medical Data is Often Distribtuted and privacy concerns prevent us from building a central data-warehouse. Using Mulit-party Secure sum we can extract process models from distributed healthcare process logs. An idea we explore in this [[paper](https://github.com/asjad99/Distributed-Process-Mining/blob/main/Distributed_Process_Mining.pdf)]. Similary we can build distributed models using techniques like fedeerated average. See the [[Paper]()] for more details. 

###### Process Analytics 
AI plays a key role in operational and strategic Business decision making. Take a look at the [Survey]() for a broad overview of AI's impact on supporting and improving business processes. I have been involved in the following projects for my PhD thesis:  

 - At operational level AI can provide recommendations to support business process executions. We explorate this application in the following project  [DeepProcess:](https://github.com/asjad99/DeepProcess) Project where we use Memory Augmented Neural Networks  for Predictive Process Monitoring. see  [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00938.pdf)] [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/deepprocess/)]

  - At Strategic level AI can help bussiness come up with robust plans. We explore this in the Alpha-GS project: [Alpha-GS](https://github.com/asjad99/rosetta_stone) - Decision making in adversarial settings using Game tree Search Combined With satisfiability(SAT)  [Paper]() [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/strategic_resilience/)] 

Deep Learning Architectures LIKE LSTMs, MANNs and Transformers provides methods for modeling sequential data problems.  


###### NLP and Knowledge Discovery :mag_right:  :file_cabinet:

Language understanding remains an ongoing challenge, and Search is not a solved problem. I have been involved in various academic and industry projects related to information retreival/knowledge discovery. I'm interested in exploring applications of  machine learning to understand language, particularly problems like [Few-Shot Text Classification](), [Summarization](), [Automated Question Answering]() and [Transfer Learning](). 

- [Latent Semantic Indexing]() - Scalable Semantic Search using Topic Modeling in Apache Spark  [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/semantic_search/)] 
- [know-how-mining](https://github.com/asjad99/know-how-mining) - Extract Know-how from text using word2vec  [ [Paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69904-2_6)]
- [Reading Comprehension] - Biomedical Question Answering using Transformers 
- [Code Search]() - 
- [Coversational AI]() - Explore LaMDA 

###### Data Mining 

Data Mining methods provide mechanisms for finding meaningful insights, patterns, trends and exceptions for decision makers.  Data Mining methods continue to be extract process models, build recommender systems 
and so on. 
  -  [Yanga](https://github.com/asjad99/Yanga)  - A framework for Building Recommender Systems using sequential Data Modeling. See [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/music/)]
  -  [Mobility-intelligence](https://github.com/asjad99/mobility-intelligence) - Geospatial and Temporal Data Analysis for revealing Taxi Driver's Mobility intelligence [Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/revealing-taxi-drivers-mobility-intelligence-through-his-trace/)


#### Open Source Learning:   :octopus:

I like the idea of having [a learning road map](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#machine-learning-roadmap) and documenting your learning journey.
