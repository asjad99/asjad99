####  Hi there 👋

I'm a final year computer science Ph.D. student :mortar_board: at the University of Wollongong :classical_building:. My recent work centres around exploring applications of machine learning for process analytics, expert decision support and Natural Language Understanding of domain specific text. I have a passion for building intelligent systems(data products) and using them to solve real world problems. I write about my experiences at https://www.asjadk.io. I enjoy coding in Python and am a open-source enthusiast. Below i have shared some of the my recent Research Prototypes (Proof-of-Concept), course projects and side projects done in the past.

####  Research Projects  🔭 :electron:	

I'm intereted in studying and developing intelligent algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support models targeted at thinking, perception and action.  My recent focus has largely been on Applied Machine Learning, which is is full of [fascinating open problems](https://www.asjadk.io/real-world-rl/) like [Generalization](https://www.asjadk.io/generalization/), [intelligent exploration vs exploitation](https://www.asjadk.io/strategic-exploration-in-online-decision-making/), [counter-factual evaluation](https://www.asjadk.io/counterfactual-policy-evaluation/), Meta-Learning
 and Sample Efficient Learning. Progress in solving these problems, can have a major impact on domains like industrial automation, healthcare and Education. 


##### Decision Support Systems: 

###### Healthcare 

Digitization of healthcare data along algorithmic breakthroughts in AI will have a major impact on healthcare delivery in coming years. I'm particularly interested in application of AI to assist clinicians during partient treatment in a privacy preserving way. While scientific knowledge can help guide interventions, there remains a key need to quickly cut through the space of decision policies to find effective strategies to support patients during the care process. 
 
- In  [MIMIC-RL](https://github.com/asjad99/MIMIC_RL_COACH) I investigate the problem of developing a Clinical Decision Support System for Sepsis Management using Deep Reinforcement Learning. In our implementation we try to answer the following question: Given a particular patient’s characteristics and physiological information at each time step as input, can our proposed framework learn an optimal treatment policy that can prescribe the right intervention(e.g use of ventilator) to the patient each stage of the treatment process, in order to improve the final outcome(e.g patient mortality)?   [[Paper]()] . 
- Medical Data is often geographically dispersed distribtuted and privacy concerns can prevent us from building a central data-warehouse. Using Techniques like fedderated learning and differential privacy we can extract process models from distributed healthcare process logs. We explore the mulit [[paper](https://github.com/asjad99/Distributed-Process-Mining/blob/main/Distributed_Process_Mining.pdf)]. Similary we explore techniques like federated averaging. See the [[Paper]()] for more details. 

###### Process Analytics 
AI plays a key role in operational and strategic Business decision making. Take a look at the [Survey]() for a broad overview of AI's impact on supporting and improving business processes. I have been involved in the following projects for my PhD thesis:  

 - At operational level AI can provide recommendations to support business process executions. Deep Learning Architectures LIKE LSTMs, MANNs and Transformers provides methods for modeling sequential data problems. In  [DeepProcess:](https://github.com/asjad99/DeepProcess) Project we use Memory Augmented Neural Networks  for Predictive Process Monitoring. see  [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00938.pdf)] 

  - At Strategic level AI can help bussiness come up with robust plans. We explore this in the Alpha-GS project: [Alpha-GS](https://github.com/asjad99/rosetta_stone) - Decision making in adversarial settings using Game tree Search Combined With satisfiability(SAT)  [[Paper]()] [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/strategic_resilience/)] 



##### NLP and Knowledge Discovery :mag_right:  :file_cabinet:

> "80% of all information created today is unstructured (free text with little structural explanation). In 2017 alone the information created was expected to be greater than the previous 5000 years combined. In addition to sheer volume, the rate of information creation is accelerating rapidly, 10x per year by 2025, which is also the year each human is expected to interact with connected devices nearly 5000 times each day." 

Language understanding remains an ongoing challenge, and Search is not a solved problem. I have been involved in various academic and industry projects related to information retreival/knowledge discovery. I'm interested in exploring applications of  machine learning to understand language, particularly problems like [Few-Shot Text Classification], [Summarization], [Automated Question Answering] and [Transfer Learning].

##### Data Mining 

Data Mining methods provide mechanisms for finding meaningful insights, patterns, trends and exceptions for decision makers.  Data Mining methods continue to be extract process models, build recommender systems 
and so on.

#### Open Source Learning:   :octopus:

I like the idea of having [a learning road map](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#machine-learning-roadmap) and documenting your learning journey.

“If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”
