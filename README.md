###  About me:

I’m passionate about the intersection of data science and  building data products. My recent work centres around exploring applications of machine learning and data centric computing for process analytics, NLP and decision support systems.

#### Selected Projects  :electron:	

I have a passion for developing data products by  incorporating emerging machine intelligence technologies. Over the years, I have worked with several researchers and high-growth startup teams to build machine learning-based solutions in area like like Business Process Analytics, [Semantic Search](https://blog.asjadk.com/semantic_search/), and [recommender systems](https://blog.asjadk.com/music/)
