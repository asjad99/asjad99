##  About:

I have a background in computer science and AI, and I design, build, and operate data solutions that serve customers at scale. Previously, I worked with the core teams of several early-stage and high-growth startups, serving as both a data scientist and a software engineer. My role involved building AI-driven products and solutions in areas like [Business Process Analytics](https://www.asjadk.com/deepprocess/), [Information Retreival](https://www.asjadk.com/semantic_search/), and [recommender systems](https://www.asjadk.com/music/). I have expertise in Algorithmic thinking, Rapid Prototyping via design thinking and R&D thinking through first principles.I am a lifelong learner, striving to learn the art of i) Building High-Performance Technology Organizations. ii) Product Management of Data Products. iii) Design and Construction of Intelligent Systems

*Programming is the art of Function, Form, Logic, and Balance.*

*Utility of the working program provides Function.*

*Organization and good abstraction creates Form.*

*The correctness is established with Logic.*

*Limitations and tradeoffs require harmonious Balance.*
