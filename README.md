###  About:
I have a background in computer science and AI.  I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Invertigro. Previously, I have worked with core teams of several early-stage and high-growth startups, as a data scientist and as well as a software engineer to build AI driven products and solutions in areas like [Business Process Analytics](https://www.asjadk.com/deepprocess/), [Information Retreival](https://www.asjadk.com/semantic_search/), and [recommender systems](https://www.asjadk.com/music/). 

I'm a life long learner, who is trying to master the art of the following: 

- Building High Performing Technology Organizations (with adaptive AI-Driven Processes)
- Intelligent Software Design and Construction
- Data Product Management (Technical)

#### Selected Projects  :electron:	

My projects incorporate emerging machine intelligence technologies and explore applications of augmented intelligence for effective decision making under uncertainty.

*Programming is the art of Function, Form, Logic, and Balance.*

*Utility of the working program provides Function.*

*Organization and good abstraction creates Form.*

*The correctness is established with Logic.*

*Limitations and tradeoffs require harmonious Balance.*
