### Hi there üëã
 	
- I'm currently working at DSL Lab (UoW).
- My interests include: programming languages, computer graphics/vision and Artificial intelligence.
- I write about my experiences at https://medium.com/@charlespierse
-  Following projects/Prototypes explore ideas in computer science and their applications in real world.

### Web  
- [twitter-graph]() 
- Elastic Search   - Elastic Search for Profile Search implemented elastic search
- Chrome Extension - is a social marketing tool. It leverages your linkedIn graph to find existing connections/friends in your graph, that can help introduce you to new people. 
- [Python Crawler](https://github.com/asjad99/datascience-GYM/blob/master/Data_engineering/web_crawler.py) - Web Crawlers (Python/JSON) for data collection via scrapping


### Mobile 

-  is an iOS app providing similar functionality as It provides features such as receiving Bitcoins with your unique identify stored on a decentralized blockchain. It is powered by the same technology as that of BitCoin technology
- IntroMe: The apps semi-automates the process of introducing people by quickly send "intro" emails 
- (CoinMarketCap) [] -  The app keeps you up-to date with the latest prices of the most popular crypto currencies exchange rates around the globe. Currencies supported: NameCoin, LiteCoin , BitCoin , NovaCoin, PeerCoin , FeatherCoin, TerraCoin 
- Raven RAVEN Messenger is a fast, and fun way to quickly capture and share moments with friends and family. Users have the option of a one to one or a group chat.
- (insta-print)[]: provides a no-hassle way of printing your digital photos(fb,instagram or gallery photos). The app collects print orders and allows the users to preview and make adjustments before sending them to the printing studio.  Efficient algorithms employed in the app ensure that the photo-quality is preserved during the sharing process.


### Open Source Learning: 

Following Projects and notebooks are currently 'work in progress'. This provides me an opportunity to document some of my own learnings and acts as a [road map](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#fundamentals) for self-taught learners out there to learn CS/ML/data science for free. 

- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/asjad99/Machine-Learning-GYM)
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/asjad99/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning)
- [Data Science](https://github.com/asjad99/datascience-GYM) 
- [Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing] 
- [Distributed Computing and Data Engineering]  
- [Theoratical Computer Science and Data Algorithms](https://github.com/asjad99/Algorithms_GYM) - Useful algorithms in Computer Science and Data Science
- [Process Analytics](https://github.com/asjad99/process-analytics)
- [Math for AI and CS](https://www.overleaf.com/project/60321e0c4ca63c16ec680cde)

### Software Engineering 
- [Large Scale Autoamted Software Testing](https://github.com/asjad99/Software-Testing-/blob/master/Report.pdf)
- [Large Scale Requirements Engineering](https://github.com/asjad99/Requirements-Engineering-) (doc. only)
- [Project Management](https://github.com/asjad99/project-management) 

### Programming Paradigms   

We explore various Programming Paradigms and computationally intelligent mathematical tools:   

- [The functional paradigm (using LISP)](https://github.com/asjad99/lisp-practice) 
- [Logic programming language in Prolog](https://github.com/asjad99/Prolog) - Solves basic problem like Prime Number finder etc
- [Concurrent Programming in NXC]
- [Object-Oriented programming in Java]()
- [Procedural Programming with C]() 


I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we‚Äôre tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn‚Äôt look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts.

And that‚Äôs what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it‚Äôs the most remarkable tool that we‚Äôve ever come up with, and it‚Äôs the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.‚Äù ~ Steve Jobs
