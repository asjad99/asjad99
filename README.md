####  Hi there 👋

 I'm a final year computer science Ph.D. student :mortar_board: at the University of Wollongong :classical_building:. My recent work centres around exploring applications of machine learning for process analytics, expert decision support and Natural Language Understanding of domain specific text. I have a passion for building intelligent systems(data products) and using them to solve real world problems. I write about my experiences at https://www.asjadk.io. I enjoy coding in Python and am a open-source enthusiast. Below i have shared some of the my recent Research Prototypes (Proof-of-Concept), course projects and side projects done in the past.

####  Research Projects  🔭


###### AI and Deep Learning :electron:	

- Machine learning and Reinforcement Learning is full of [fascinating open problems](https://www.asjadk.io/real-world-rl/) like [Generalization](https://www.asjadk.io/generalization/), [intelligent exploration vs exploitation](https://www.asjadk.io/strategic-exploration-in-online-decision-making/), [counter-factual evaluation](https://www.asjadk.io/counterfactual-policy-evaluation/) and Sample Efficient Learning. Progress in solving these problems, can have a major impact impact on domains like industrial automation, healthcare and Education. I explore the healthcare applications of machine learning in the following project: 

  -  [MIMIC-RL](https://github.com/asjad99/MIMIC_RL_COACH) -  This paper proides a framework Decision Support for Clinicians treating Sepsis using Deep Reinforcement Learning.  While scientific knowledge can help guide interventions, there remains a key need to quickly cut through the space of decision policies to find effective strategies to support people. We implement a case study to answer the question: Given a particular patient’s characteristics and physiological information ateach time step as input, can our proposed framework learn an optimal treatmentpolicy that can prescribe the right intervention(e.g use of ventilator) to the patientat each stage of the treatment process, in order to improve the final outcome(e.gpatient mortality)?   [[Paper]()] [[Blog Post]()]. 

- AI plays a key role in operational and strategic business Decision Making. I Survey the broad overview of AI's impact on Supporting and improving business processes.  
 
   - At operational level AI can provide recommendations to support business process executions. We explorate this application in the following project  [DeepProcess:](https://github.com/asjad99/DeepProcess) Project where we use Memory Augmented Neural Networks  for Predictive Process Monitoring. see  [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00938.pdf)] [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/deepprocess/)]

   - At Strategic level AI can help bussiness come up with robust plans. We explore this in the Alpha-GS project: [Alpha-GS](https://github.com/asjad99/rosetta_stone) - Decision making in adversarial settings using Game tree Search Combined With satisfiability(SAT)  [Paper]() [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/strategic_resilience/)] 

- Deep Learning Architectures LIKE LSTMs, MANNs and Transformers provides methods for modeling sequatial data problems.  
  -  [Yanga](https://github.com/asjad99/Yanga)  - A framework for Sequential Data Modeling [[Case Study](https://www.asjadk.io/music/)]


###### Data Mining 

Data Mining methods provide mechanisms for finding meaningful insights, patterns, trends and exceptions for decision makers.  Data Mining methods continue to be 

- [Mobility-intelligence](https://github.com/asjad99/mobility-intelligence) - Geospatial and Temporal Data Analysis for revealing Taxi Driver's Mobility intelligence [Blog Post]()
- [Distributed Process Mining]() [Paper]()
- [Federated Learaning]() [Paper]()

#### Information Retreival :file_cabinet: :mag_right:

Information retreival is an interesting with a lot of room for contribution. I have been involved in various academic and industry projects related to information retreival. I'm interested in exploring applications of NLP in making search better. 

- [Latent Semantic Indexing]() - Scalable Topic Modeling in Apache Spark  [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/semantic_search/)] 
- [know-how-mining](https://github.com/asjad99/know-how-mining) - Semantic Similarity using word2vec  [ [Paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69904-2_6)]
- [Question-Answering] - Biomedical Question Answering

see [Paper]() for a combined end-to-end IR system


#### Computer Graphics / Image Processing :yarn:
- [Sketch](https://github.com/asjad99/Sketch), [Automated Image Segmentation](https://github.com/asjad99/Image-Processing), [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://github.com/asjad99/Rock-Paper-Scissors-), [Robo-Soccor](https://github.com/asjad99/robot-soccor), [Mars Terrain Mapping](https://github.com/asjad99/mars_pathfinder_robot),[Education-Unity-Kinect](https://github.com/asjad99/KINEFF)

#### Web/Mobile :turtle:

- [Elastic Search]() 
- [twitter-graph]() 
- Chrome Extension - is a social marketing tool. It leverages your linkedIn graph to find existing connections/friends in your graph, that can help introduce you to new people. 
- [Python Crawler](https://github.com/asjad99/datascience-GYM/blob/master/Data_engineering/web_crawler.py) - Web Crawlers (Python/JSON) for data collection via scrapping
-  is an iOS app providing similar functionality as It provides features such as receiving Bitcoins with your unique identify stored on a decentralized blockchain. It is powered by the same technology as that of BitCoin technology

##### IOS APPS: :iphone: 
  [IntroMe](https://github.com/asjad99/IntroMe),  [CoinMarketCap](https://github.com/asjad99/CoinMarketCap),  [insta-print](https://github.com/asjad99/InstaPrint), [Raven](https://github.com/asjad99/Raven)
