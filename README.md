####  Hi there 👋

 - I'm a final year computer science Ph.D. student :mortar_board: at the University of Wollongong :classical_building:
 - My recent work centres around exploring applications of machine learning for process analytics, expert decision support and Natural Language Understanding of domain specific text. 
 - I have a passion for building intelligent systems(data products) and using them to solve real world problems. I write about my experiences at https://www.asjadk.io
 - I enjoy coding in Python and am a open-source enthusiast. Below i have shared some of the my recent Research Prototypes (Proof-of-Concept), course projects and side projects done in the past.

####  Research Projects  🔭


###### AI and Deep Learning :electron:	

Machine learning is full of fascinating open problems like Generalization, intelligent exploration vs exploitation in the context of RL agents, and Counter-factual Learning. It holds the potential to have a deep impact on domains like industrial automation, healthcare and Education. I explore the healthcare applications of machine learning in the following project: 

- [MIMIC-RL](https://github.com/asjad99/MIMIC_RL_COACH) -  Decision Support for Clinicians treating Sepsis using Deep Reinforcement Learning   [[Paper]()] [[Blog Post]()]

AI plays a key role in operation and strategic future business Decision making in adversarial settings using Game tree Search Combined With satisfiability(SAT)

At operational level AI can provide recommendations to support business process executions: 

- [DeepProcess:](https://github.com/asjad99/DeepProcess) - Predictive Process Monitoring using Memory Augmented Neural Networks [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00938.pdf)] [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/deepprocess/)]

At Strategic level it can help bussiness come up with robust plans. We explore this in the following project: 

- [Alpha-GS](https://github.com/asjad99/rosetta_stone) -   [Paper]() [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/strategic_resilience/)] 

Deep Learning Architectures LIKE LSTMs, MANNs and Transformers provides methods for modeling sequatial data problems.  

- [Yanga](https://github.com/asjad99/Yanga)  - A framework for Sequential Data Modeling [[Case Study](https://www.asjadk.io/music/)]


###### Data Mining 

Data Mining methods provide mechanisms for finding meaningful insights, patterns, trends and exceptions for decision makers.  Data Mining methods continue to be 

- [Mobility-intelligence](https://github.com/asjad99/mobility-intelligence) - Geospatial and Temporal Data Analysis for revealing Taxi Driver's Mobility intelligence [Blog Post]()
- [Distributed Process Mining]() [Paper]()
- [Federated Learaning]() [Paper]()

###### Information Retreival :file_cabinet: :mag_right:

I find the topic of Information retreival 

I have been involved in various academic and industry projects related to information retreival. I'm interested in exploring applications of NLP in making search better. 


- [Latent Semantic Indexing]() - Scalable Topic Modeling in Apache Spark  [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/semantic_search/)] 
- [know-how-mining](https://github.com/asjad99/know-how-mining) - Semantic Similarity using word2vec  [ [Paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69904-2_6)]
- [Question-Answering] - Biomedical Question Answering

see [Paper]() for a combined end-to-end IR system


#### Computer Graphics / Image Processing :yarn:
- [Sketch](https://github.com/asjad99/Sketch) -  A MS. paint like application implemented in Java
- [Automated Image Segmentation](https://github.com/asjad99/Image-Processing) - Automated Removal of Image Compression Artifacts Improves an algorithm proposed by Luo and Ward for the removal of edges of the blocks in regions that are affected by blockiness effects.
- [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://github.com/asjad99/Rock-Paper-Scissors-) - object detection, Implemented in Labview, to classify hand images. It allows users to play the classic rock paper scissors game with the computer.
- [Robo-Soccor](https://github.com/asjad99/robot-soccor) - Lego based Autonomous Robot Capable of playing soccer using a spray painted Squash ball.
- [Mars Terrain Mapping](https://github.com/asjad99/mars_pathfinder_robot) - Navgiate around to map the mars terrain using Unity 3D simulation 
- [Education-Unity-Kinect](https://github.com/asjad99/KINEFF)  


-----
#### Web/Mobile :turtle:

- [Elastic Search]() 
- [twitter-graph]() 
- Chrome Extension - is a social marketing tool. It leverages your linkedIn graph to find existing connections/friends in your graph, that can help introduce you to new people. 
- [Python Crawler](https://github.com/asjad99/datascience-GYM/blob/master/Data_engineering/web_crawler.py) - Web Crawlers (Python/JSON) for data collection via scrapping
-  is an iOS app providing similar functionality as It provides features such as receiving Bitcoins with your unique identify stored on a decentralized blockchain. It is powered by the same technology as that of BitCoin technology

##### IOS APPS: :iphone: 
  [IntroMe](https://github.com/asjad99/IntroMe),  [CoinMarketCap](https://github.com/asjad99/CoinMarketCap),  [insta-print](https://github.com/asjad99/InstaPrint), [Raven](https://github.com/asjad99/Raven)
