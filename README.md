###  About:
I have a PhD in applied machine learning with a computer science and engineering background.  I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Invertigro. Previously, I have worked with core teams of several early-stage and high-growth startups, as a data scientist and as well as a software engineer to build AI driven products and solutions in domains like [Business Process Analytics](https://blog.asjadk.com/deepprocess/), [Information Retreival](https://blog.asjadk.com/semantic_search/), and [recommender systems](https://blog.asjadk.com/music/). 

I love getting to know people around the world who are building interesting cool stuff. You can reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asjad/) and tell me where you are and what you’re working on.

*Programming is the art of Function, Form, Logic, and Balance.
Utility of the working program provides Function.
Organization and good abstraction creates Form.
The correctness is established with Logic.
Limitations and tradeoffs require harmonious Balance.*- Jeremy Kun
